        <h3>Post-secondary education</h3>
        <p>
          In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the
          only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when he
          was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The
          match per the customs prevailing at that time was arranged by the
          couple's parents.

        <h3>Studies at the University of Bombay</h3>
        <p>
          In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following
          year he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the
          University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his
          Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard
          examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because
          they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was
          "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other
          communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success,
          by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented
          with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a
          family friend. By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and
          political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up
          employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved
          his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to
          Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.

        <h3>Studies at Columbia University</h3>
        <p>
          In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State
          Scholarship of Â£11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a
          scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that
          was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at
          Columbia University in New York City. Soon after arriving there he
          settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who
          was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915,
          majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History,
          Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian
          Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on
          democracy. In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National
          Dividend of India - A Historic and Analytical Study, for a second M.A.
          On 9 May, he presented the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism,
          Genesis and Development before a seminar conducted by the
          anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D.
          degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.

        <h3>Studies at the London School of Economics</h3>
        <p>
          In October 1916, he enrolled for the Bar course at Gray's Inn, and at
          the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he
          started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to
          India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection
          was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that
          ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. He got
          permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years.
          He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree
          in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and
          its solution". In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which
          was awarded from University of London, and the same year he was called
          to the Bar by Gray's Inn.
