      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        Ambedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on
        modern India. In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is
        respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced
        various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at
        socio-economic policies, education and affirmative action through
        socio-economic and legal incentives. His reputation as a scholar led to
        his appointment as free India's first law minister, and chairman of the
        committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in
        individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of
        Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him
        controversial and unpopular among Hindus. His conversion to Buddhism
        sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and
        abroad.

        The Maharashtra government has acquired a house in London where Ambedkar
        lived during his days as a student in the 1920s. The house is expected
        to be converted into a museum-cum-memorial to Ambedkar.

        said that Ambedkar is <q>father of my economics</q>, and
        <q
          >he was highly controversial figure in his home country, though it was

          marvelous and will be remembered forever.</q
