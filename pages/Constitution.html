      <h3>The drafting of India's Constitution</h3>
      <p>
        Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister
        Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of India's
        Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of the Drafting
        Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 25 November 1949, Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent
        assembly said:-
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        <q>
          The credit that is given to me does not really belong to me. It
          belongs partly to Sir B.N. Rau the Constitutional Advisor to the
          Constituent Assembly who prepared a rough draft of the Constitution
          for the consideration of the Drafting Committee.</q
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Indian constitution guarantees and protections for a wide range of civil
        liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the
        abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of
        discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights
        for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of
        reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for
        members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward
        Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India's lawmakers hoped to
        eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for
        India's depressed classes through these measures. The Constitution was
        adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.
